## Discussions

Are there any features you want me to remove?

Discuss the main menu and the options with relation to child items.
- Vertical menu will have a benefit because the will be no limit that will affect the design however the children may look funny.
- Horizontal will have the benefit of having nice children but there will be a limit of categories you can have

- Discuss reviews (then need to be manually enabled). Do you want to approve them or let them go through automatically? Bots can be a pain in the butt!

Do you want the category description on the product pages? I have currently remove them.
